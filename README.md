# RTOS Window Manager

## Overview

The RTOS Window Manager is a software system designed for Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) that efficiently manages passenger and driver windows. Leveraging advanced synchronization mechanisms such as queues, semaphores, and mutex locks, this system ensures smooth multitasking and enhances the user interface experience.

## Features

- **Queue Management**: Implements a queue-based approach to handle multiple window requests, ensuring orderly processing.
- **Semaphore Control**: Uses semaphores to manage concurrent access to windows, preventing conflicts and ensuring data integrity.
- **Mutex Locking**: Employs mutex locks to safeguard critical sections of code, avoiding race conditions and enhancing system reliability.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with varying RTOS environments and application requirements.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a straightforward interface for easy interaction and configuration.
